<h2>ai machine vision</h2>
  <p>It is a technology used to inspect the quality of products through optical instruments, such as finish, color, and physical defects. It was actively introduced in Korea until the late 2000s. In most factories, it was used to inspect defective products at the end of the production process as a part of Quality Assurance (QA).</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
 <p>Recently, by combining advanced technologies such as advanced optical technology, artificial intelligence, and big data analysis with this machine vision, more accurate and analytical quality inspection has become possible. In particular, it has advanced to the level of filming objects and judging like people, and analyzing parts that are difficult to distinguish in relation to each other. Thanks to this, research and development are progressing beyond quality inspection to the level of monitoring factories or inspecting the inside and outside of facilities.</p>
 <h2>From QA to factory monitoring</h2>
 <p>Today's machine vision goes one step further. Optics are installed not only on the production line, but also throughout the factory. The unstructured data captured here is analyzed with artificial intelligence to predict or judge defects or failures. Through tracking production on the production line, it also enables overall monitoring, such as understanding performance and forecasting production. Data generated by machine vision can also be analyzed along with manufacturing process data to help pinpoint the cause of defects.</p>
