<h2>Technology meets education: Edutech</h2>
  <p>As we enter the 4th industrial society, various AI-type learning technologies are introduced, and even the use of AI-type robot blocks, online encyclopedias, and AI assistant teachers, etc. It is changing into a form of meeting of education. The meeting of technology and education is rapidly spreading in the educational field with the concept of EduTech. Edutech can be seen as a convergence education method that combines artificial intelligence, robots, and educational contents.</p>
<h2>Convergence of hardware and software ‘Edutech’</h2>
 <p>Edutech has the advantage that it can be used to develop problem-solving ability in simple knowledge transfer rather than infusion-type education, which can be seen as a disadvantage of face-to-face learning. Through learning that combines Edutech's information technology, experiential learning and active learning are possible, and it can be viewed as an education that allows a lot of imagination and problem-solving power to be put into a machine to share experiences. If we consider that education so far has been a distinction between hardware and software, the introduction of Edutech can be seen as a convergence of hardware and software.
  In a way, it can be seen as a combination of technology and education that can cause debates about whether it is educational innovation or an educational renaissance.</p>
<ul><h2>Advantages and disadvantages of edtech</h2>
 <p>Looking at the strengths, Edutech breaks away from education that memorizes and acquires contents through a uniform curriculum and the process of education, and allows learners to take their own initiative as needed. In that it is a learning tool that can experience, experience, and solve problems, it can be seen that it has a useful value in different aspects from the existing classroom-centered school education.</p>
 <p>Edutech is not all-round for all learners and for all educational contents. This is because edutech may have limitations in containing content that is software, and if it becomes a hardware-oriented edutech that only arouses curiosity without content, it will face limitations in terms of effectiveness. For the time being, it is expected that face-to-face traditional education methods and educational methods utilizing Edu-Tech will be used in parallel, but given the current pace of technological development, it is predicted that AI-type Edu-Tech will play a leading role in the education field in the very near future.</<progress value="0" max="100">0%</progress>>
